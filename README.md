Archived: ownCloud Photo Upload App
=========================
The ownCloud Photo Upload was an application for Firefox OS that allowed users to 
send photos to a specified ownCloud server. Firefox OS was shuttered and the app no longer has any functionality, but the code remains here for reference.

--------------------------

Setup
-----
To work on the project, you will need to have a development environment for Firefox OS set up. You might wish to use the [App Manager](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Using_the_App_Manager).

Configuration
-------------
For testing purposes, you will need to create a local directory called "gaia" for the Firefox OS to read from. (This is a temporary workaround to avoid the app cycling through every photograph in your local Pictures directory.)

* **If testing on an FxOS mobile device:** create a “gaia”directory within the phone or tablet’s photo storage area.
* **If using the simulator on a computer:** create the “gaia” directory inside your default photo directory. 

You will also need to create a "gaia" folder in the ownCloud server's "photos" directory to "catch" the uploaded photos.
